I'm a Python developer focused on **Telegram bots and userbots**.

The creator of [**RimTUB**](https://github.com/RimTUB/RimTUB) — a flexible, modular Telegram userbot that lets users control their Telegram experience with precision and freedom.

I build tools that are **useful**, **clean**, and **open**.  
No unnecessary complexity, no heavy stacks. Just logic, architecture, and code that solves real problems.

## 💭 Philosophy

I’m not chasing trends. I don’t care about hype stacks.  
What I care about is **clarity** — in code, in structure, in what a tool does and how it behaves.

> Code, to me, is not just a sequence of characters.  
> It is something far more important — my temple, my life.

- I value reliability and practicality over hype and fleeting trends.  

- I believe good projects are those that adapt to you, not the other way around.

- Programming is not just writing code.  
  It’s your intuition, your logic, your soul expressed through lines.

> Great code doesn’t shout — it listens, supports, and lasts.  
> It’s the quiet bridge between idea and reality.

## 🧠 My Stack & Focus

- 🧠 **Python** & **Telegram** my everything
- 💬 **Telegram Bot & Userbot development** (async TeleBot, Kurigram)  
- 🖥️ Desktop tools & CLI utilities
- 🌐 Backend APIs (FastAPI)  
- 🧩 And other usual stuff (JSON, asyncio, SQL, etc.)

I write code that works.  
I code from the heart, not for money.  
I automate everything I can.  
I see no impossible in the possible.

---

## 💼 Freelance & Work

I also work as a freelancer — building bots, userbots and other things for Telegram, and not only that.
If you want a clean & reliable backend, a fast & powerful bot, or a reliable tool — I am right here.

- I don’t promise magic.  
- I **do** promise code that **works**, **makes sense**, and **doesn’t break** in **two weeks**.


### 🤖 Telegram Bot Development

**Telegram bots on request** — for personal, community, or business use.

#### ✅ What I can do:
- Bots of simple to medium complexity — no crypto-trading, but I can try making store bots, utilities, etc.  
- Buttons of any shape and logic  
- Full message formatting (HTML, emojis, media, stickers, anything you like)  
- Multilingual support (so that **everyone** can use your bot)  
- Pagination systems (dividing something into pages)
- CAPTCHA systems (like [It's Captcha](https://github.com/RimMirK/ItsCaptchaBot))  
- Telegram Stars ⭐️ payments  
- 🦋 CryptoBot and 🚀 xRocket integration 
- Database integration (SQLite, JSON, etc.)  
- API integrations
- Mailing/broadcasting systems  
- Hosting setup assistance

### 🚫 What I haven’t done (but can try):
- Telegram Mini Apps  
- Crypto payments (except CryptoBot and xRocket)
- Payment provider integrations (except MonoBank)

## ❗ I do not work on anything illegal or unethical:  
No scam, no spam, no casinos, no “gray” bots.
